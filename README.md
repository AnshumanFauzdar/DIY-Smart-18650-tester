# DIY Smart 18650 tester

## Initial Idea:

I am trying to make smart 18650 tester/voltmeter so that I can quickly check my old salvaged batteries, using Arduino based microcontroller is easy as it is made for 5v input and output and I have to figure it out for ESP8266 based board, so that I can divide the voltage and then measure the voltage and capacity.

Using wifi based microcontroller gives access to smart monitoring and remote acess and more stuff like data logging!
